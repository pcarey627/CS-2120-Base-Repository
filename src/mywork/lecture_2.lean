INFERENCE RULE #1/2: EQUALITY IS REFLEXIVE

Everything is equal to itself. A bit more formally,
if one is given a type, T, and a value, t, of this
type, then you may have a proof of t = t "for free."
-/

axiom eq_refl  : 
  ∀ (T : Type)  -- if T is any type (of thing)
    (t : T),    -- and t is thing of that type, T
  t = t         -- the result type: proof of t = t

/-
Ok, you actually have to *apply* the axiom of reflexive equality. 
-/

example : 1 = 1 := eq_refl ℕ 1  -- Our definition
example : 1 = 1 := @eq.refl ℕ 1 -- Lean, with inference turned off by @
example : 1 = 1 := eq.refl 1    -- Lean's definition  with T=ℕ inferred

INFERENCE RULE #2/2: SUBSTITUTION OF EQUALS FOR EQUALS

Given any type, T, of objects, and any *property*, P,
of objects of this type, if you know x has property P
(written as P x) and you know that x = y, then you can
deduce that y has property P.
-/
axiom eq_subst : 
  ∀ (T : Type)      -- if T is a type
    (P : T → Prop)  -- and P is a property of T objects
    (x y : T)       -- and x and y are T objects
    (e : x = y)     -- and you have a proof that x = y
    (px : P x),     -- and you have a proof that x has property P
  P y               -- then you can deduce (and get a proof) of P y

SOME EXAMPLES
-/

-- a predicate is a proposition with arguments
def eq_3_3 : Prop := 3 = 3          -- proposition
def eq_n_3 (n : ℕ) : Prop := n = 3  -- predicate

-- predicates applied to values yield propositions
-- hover your mouse pointer over #reduce to see result
#reduce eq_n_3 2
#reduce eq_n_3 3
#reduce eq_n_3 4

-- Axioms are just assumptions, so let's make some
axioms 
  (aType : Type)              -- e.g., nat
  (aProperty : aType → Prop)  -- e.g., eq_n_3
  (x y : aType)               -- arbitary nats
  (e : x = y)                 -- a proof x = y
  (px : aProperty x)          -- proof of eq_n_3 x

/-
Given the preceding assumptions,
can we prove aPred y?
-/

-- Yes, just apply the substitutability axiom
theorem aTheorem : aProperty y :=      
  eq_subst    -- apply the axiom to the following arguments
    aType     -- the type
    aProperty -- the property
    x y       -- the values
    e         -- the proof of x = y
    px        -- the proof that x has aProperty

-- And the result is a ...
#check aTheorem -- ... proof of P y!

/- 
You can (often) think of inference rules 
as functions that can take proofs as arguments
and that return proofs as results. The secret
sauce here is that you *cannot* apply such a
function unless you have the arguments that 
it requires. So, for example, if you don't 
have and can't construct a proof of x = y,
then you simply cannot apply/use the eq_subset
inference rule.
-/

/-
By the way, eq_subst is defined in Lean as
eq.subst.
-/

theorem aTheorem' : aProperty y :=      
  @eq.subst     -- yes! apply the axiom to
    aType       -- the type
    aProperty   -- the property
    x y         -- the values
    e           -- the proof of x = y
    px          -- the proof that x as aProperty

/-
And in Lean eq.subst uses type
inference to infer T, P, x, and y,
from e, so you don't need to give
explicit values for these argument.
-/

theorem aTheorem'' : aProperty y :=      
  eq.subst     -- yes! apply the axiom to
    e           -- the proof of x = y
    px          -- the proof that x as aProperty

/-
Lean includes a proof building
scripting language, and here are 
two proofs of the same thing using
proof scripts.
-/

theorem aTheorem''' : aProperty y :=
begin
  apply eq.subst e, -- rewrite the goal proposition using e
  exact px,         -- we've already assumed that proposition is true
end

theorem aTheorem'''' : aProperty y :=
begin
  rw <- e,  -- rewrite goal using e read right to left
  exact px, -- the new goal is true by assumption
end

Theorem: *equality is symmetric*

What we are to show is that, for any objects,
x and y, of any type T, if x = y then y = x.

Proof: We'll *assume* the premises of the conjecture:
that T is a type; x and y are values of that type; and 
it's true (and we have a proof, h) x = y. Now *in the
context* of these assumptions, we need to construct a
proof that y = x. We can do that by applying the axiom
of the substitutability of equals to the proposition
to be proved, using our proof of x = y as an argument,
to substitute y for x whereever x appears. The result
is that we must now only prove y = y. And that is done
by applying the axiom of reflexivity of equality.

Here's a formal proof. What's most important at this
point is that you be able to follow how the *context*
of the proof evolves as we make each of our "moves" 
in the construction of the final proof. Use SHIFT + 
CMD/CTRL + ENTER to open the Lean Information View,
which will present the evolving proof context, then
click on each line of the proof-constructing script
we've give you here to see how each move affects the
context.

theorem eq_symm : 
  ∀ (T : Type) 
    (x y : T), 
    x = y → 
    y = x :=
begin
  assume T,
  assume x y,
  assume h, 
  rw h,
  -- rw applies eq.refl automatically to complete the proof
end

/-
Because this proposition is a universal
generalization, it can be *applied* to
particular arguments to get particular
results! Recall that e is a proof x = y.
So what do we get when we appy eq_symm
to e?  
-/

#reduce eq_symm ℕ x y x=y

Theorem: Equality is transitive

If x, y, and z are objects of some type, T, and we 
know (have proofs or axioms) that x = y and y = z,
then we can deduce (and have a proof) that x = z.
-/

theorem eq_trans : 
  ∀ (T : Type) 
    (x y z : T) 
    (e1 : x = y) 
    (e2 : y = z), 
  x = z :=
begin
  assume (T : Type), -- take as temporary axiom!
  assume (x y z : T), -- another one: context!
  assume (e1 : x = y),
  assume (e2 : y = z),
  rw e1,
  rw e2,      -- eq.refl applied automatically
end
